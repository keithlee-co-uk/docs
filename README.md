## Machine Installation

Installations are based from a base install of the [netinst](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/debian-installer/) of [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) 8.5 (Jessie)

### Development Machine

[Installing pvenv](Install Python 3.6 on Debian for development.md)

#### Install a Graphical Shell

  `sudo apt-get install task-gnome-desktop chromium`

We also installed the chromium browser here so that we can use a plugin for rendering the README files we will produce.

#### Chromium Browser plugin

Open chromium, and Click the following
Customize and Control Chromium (3 dot top left of the interface) > Settings > Extentions > Markdown Preview Plus

Install the plugin.
To ensure that the plugin refreshes frequently to save on refreshing the page each time you make a change

Click
the M with a blue background > Options > check 'Enable auto-reload'
and set to 5 seconds.

### IDE Install

[Wing IDE](http://www.wingware.com/) may be downloaded with the link.
You will need a paid for License key for the professional version, which I'll be using but the Personal and 101 versions are free License versions.
