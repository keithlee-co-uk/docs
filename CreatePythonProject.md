# Create a Project
---


* **[Index Page](README.md)**

----

This document assumes that a [develpment machine](DevelopmentMachineInstall.md) has been installed and that this is the machine that you are creating a project on.

## Steps
Though these steps may be performed in any order there are a few instruction contained in them which assume that previous steps have been completed, so following as ordered is recommended so that you do not have to back step to complete the process.

*It is intended to write something in the future to automate these processes*

  * 1 [Version Control](CreateGit.md)
  * 2 [Virtual Environment(s) for the Project and Python versions](CreateVENV.md)
